<hr>
Katana is a little script which helps you to generate a boilerplate (More than a boilerplate) to directly deploy your model in the clouds. It works pretty well with render. All you need to do is to answer some quick questions and Katana will generate templates, commons.py and everything for you just in seconds.

#### How to use it ?

> It's pretty easy. Download the katana.py, place it in a folder and answer the questions accordingly

#### What things i need in advance ?
>You need to place your checkpoint file generated by your model. Place it in the same folder and upload everything on the git.
